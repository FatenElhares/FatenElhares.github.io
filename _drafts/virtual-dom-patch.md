**Patch**
The "patch" module takes a set of patches and the primitive DOM element associated
with the source virtual DOM element and produces a primitive DOM associated with
the destination virtual DOM element.
We use *Widget* to specify how the translation from the virtual DOM
to the real DOM should go.
