Stakeholders interact with the software as it is being developed.
That changes their view as well as their expectations.
Using of the existing system as a reference for conversations
helps them identify their problems and express them claerly to the
development team.

Things change all the time.
Taking a lot of decisions early is rarely beneficical in the long run;
unless for having rich conversations,
these decisions have huge cost and little value;
Indeed, they need to be revsited frequently.
The scope, likewise, is hard to identify early.
We work toward requirements and we get them when we are done.
Software requirements, like design, are emergent.

We start with assumptions.
We assume that listing the invoices will help the client find
and update his target invoice.
But, does that really meet the need of the customer
that wants to update the last invoice due to a typing issue?
I am not sure of that.
That depends on where the invoices are found, 
what the clients are really using our system
for, when they do it, and how well the software fits in their
life.
All of that requires investigation, toughful reflection,
and a lot of trial-and-error before.

We work on problems.
A solution to a problem changes the setting of the next one.
We approach our problems one by one.
We identify the problem, we assume a solution, we test it, we get feedback,
we learn, and we reflect on our understanding of the problem as well as the
adequacy of the solution.
We repeat this until we come up with a good solution to the right problem.
And only when we end up with proof of viability of a solution
that we take it as a requirement.

Another problem, here, is that identifying the scope of the software early
hinders our ability to learn and inquire deliberately.
The stakehodlers' views change continuously.
They learn more about the solution.
Their interactions with the software give birth to a set 
of interaction patterns, by which they establish rules and habits of use.
This invalidates most of our early decisions.
