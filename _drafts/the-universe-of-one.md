"The universe of one" --Erik Erikson

**Introduction**
- A software is a knowledge medium
- A programming language is a communcation medium
- The code is the result of a learning that we communicate to the next programmer
- Programming is a social learning activity

- The software is a product of the learning
- A software solves a problem, and thus, provide value
- The more we learn about the problem, the more we are able to sovle it in better ways
- The intricate* part in software development is articulating the problem
- Finding the problem in the middle of a complex system of interactions
- Abstracting it away
- Each problem is different
- "We get what we are looking for" --someone
- So if we look for duck in the night sky, we see it drawn by the stars
- If we look for success all the time, we are going to be successful
- 
- And if we are look for problem patterns, we will end up percieving them
- It is easy to fall _slaves_ for our thinking biases
- We may articulate a false problem
- Then, we make the same old decisions and reuse the same old patterns
- It may not be a bottleneck if we discover those fallacies earlier
- Neither, if we keep the option of changing them the time we learn more about the problem
- This is hard, because we are thinking in terms of those decisions
- We either end up with an _ugly_ design
- or we _stumble_ in front of a logical dielemma/contradiction
- If those decisions were significants design decision, the cost of change will be high
-
- Each software is "a universe of one", a unique case, with its own social conditions
- Social problems are not simple that we can __ solve them by applying previously successsul solutions
-
- Keeping an open mind and learning mindset is crucial to developing software


**Patterns as knowledge medium**
- A pattern is a communication medium
- Shift _from_ pattern as solution _to_ pattern as knowldge medium
- Patterns are for communicating the learning in a specific social, technological and financial context
- Pattern as knowledge about the thinking tools and the abstractions we may need to solve _the problem_
- A pattern is an approach of thinking we _could_ use under the governence and the enabling! of specific constraints
- Patterns are highly contextual
- Software problems are also highly contextual
- Software problems are most of the time complex situation
- Understanding the context of use and the actual context are crucial to applying a pattern
- Everybody may have patterns, but each uses them implicitly
- Making implicit patterns of thinking explicit is a complicated problem

**The need for a learning mindset**
- Design a software that is willing to accept your learning
- You cannot predict what your next learning/insight will be
- Design software to accept change
- And learn how to change software safely
- Increase the ability to put the learning inside the code
- Keep a discovery/experimentationa
- Be curious

**Defining/Finding the problem over solving the problem**
- Complex condition

**Software development as a social activity**
- Solving social problems over technology problems
