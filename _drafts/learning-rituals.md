Learning should be more about habbits than about rituals.
Then, your life would be driven by learning
not that your learning become subject to your life schedule.
The problem with ritualism is that it based
on a fundamental misunderstanding of time.
Life is a continuous journey of learning.
We learn from our family, our friends, our teachers, and from our selves.


Our life is shaped by the thoughts we hold and the stories we tell to ourselves.
If we keep telling stories of sad situations that could happen in the future or that could been altered in the past, it will be normal to be anxious and afraid.
If we accept our situtation and embrace our conditions.
We will be grateful and in a harmony with our inner selves.

There are a kind of stories we keep telling to ourselves; The stories of learning rituals.
A learning ritual is a time we allocate before a week or two to arrange a condition for
doing something.

Remember when was the last time you said to yourself;
"Starting from today, every Sunday evening,
I will isolate my self in the garden, I will make a coffe, and I will finish this book".

Try to imagine how your life could be better if that promise is altered to be
"I should finish this book! I will start doing that today.
I will allocate one hour everyday after the work to reading it."

Life is better seen as journey where we try to do better and to improve everyday.
It is not a set of rituals.
