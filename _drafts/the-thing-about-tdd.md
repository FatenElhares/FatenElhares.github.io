When one fails a lot.
I believe that we grow by destroying our most held beliefs.
The stronger the belief, the brightest the learning.


While reviewing some old notes. I came across a sentences that states
"TDD is a continuous conversation with the situation where we favour exploring the problem over imposing our the synthesis of old solutions.
"
and this "Restating the problem challenges implicit premises and opens new perspectives towards unknown aspects"

* I the idea of 'exploring the problem' resonates with me more than 'solving the problem', maybe the problem is an early view of the solution, maybe the we are sensing/articulating/shaping the problem as we go.
* We learn better by discovery, not instruction, thus, design is the outcome of our continuous discovery and learning experience. Feedback and reflection enlighten our journey. Design reflects our understanding.

I once wrote also
"* If the only adequate name of a variable is the name of its class, reconcider the design, the level of abstractions, and the substance of your abstractions.
".
Well, now I will rewrite it as

- Think only about the structure when refactoring


It is the restructuring
of the perception of the phenomena which [...] a generative metaphor for the researchers in the sense that
it generated new perceptions, explanations, and inventions.
