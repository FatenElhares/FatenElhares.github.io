- data abstraction:
  - need for an interace (common interaface a-la unix file interface and control through pipe-&-filter?)
- control abstraction:
  - abstraction of the control flow
  - goes hand in hand with data abstraction
  - think of macros in Lisp, do .. while, if..
  - examples: do ..while, loops, function invocation, mapping, local/non-local exits
  - control structures: function invocation, initialization,  ...
- Procedural abstraction
- functional abstraction:
  - higher order function allow to define control abstraction
