The important thing is to create your own equilibrium and
impose your own order in contrast with the surrounding.
The order must not be affectected with the noise and your
ineer self should live at a consistent peace no matter
what is happening outside, I mean your breath should not
get faster, you thinking does not go far, and your incentive
to react should not be triggered.

Also the stories lived should never set the cornerstones
to the stories of your future self.
Allow a room for exploration and for unlearning both habbits
and knowledge of the past.

Think critically about the culture you are in.
As I am growing older, I am discovering again and again
that intellectual freedom is a crucial necessity for the
life of the human kind.

The failure is decored by stories and rigerously woved metaphors
to make you ashaimed and to put the focus on avoiding the mistake
than reflecting and learning from it.
Most of what we define as failure is indeed a normal stage
of life, it is the way the life gives lessons.
