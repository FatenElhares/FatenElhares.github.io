Programmjng is the collection of decisions we make along the journey
of growing the software.

The software is not the product, the product is the value provided
by the software for its users.

Customers don't buy software for the seek of enjoying playing
around with its features. Internet navigators don't visit your
website seeking the discovery of the content you provide.
They are mostly there because Google led them to settle in your
island.

If you optimize your process for the software. You are spending your
money on a losed battle, on solving the wrong problem, and on the unncessary
stuff. Better to focus on the customer and their needs.

The think you should take for granted is that "A cool software" has never
been the customer need, and unless the customer is a designer or a web
developer seeking some inspiration in a discovery travel, that would not
matter.

It is after all "People and interaction over processes and tools"."The universe of one" --Erik Erikson
