10 situation I won't use TDD

- I write code I will never change:
  It is enough to test it manually one time
  
- I am figuring out how to make it work:
  The frequency of changing aip is high

- I can get faster feedback than running tests:
  (working on one page prototype
  -> with the right tools, simple page refresh is enough)
  Mistaken for repl-over-tdd dichotomy.
  But I am talking about other means of verification
  than running automated checks

- When I am in the middle of the process of isolating code

- When I copy-past code
