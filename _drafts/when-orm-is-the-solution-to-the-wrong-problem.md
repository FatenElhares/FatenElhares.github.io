The software could be seen through various lenses.
Each lense carries its own set of constraints.
Database, for instance, as complicated component in the system.
Building a new database engine for each new project brings an unacceptable cost.
So, let's look to the trade-off we face with an off-the-shelf database.
We benefit from data consistency while we loose flexibility in the representation of that data.

The aim of ORM is to loosen the mismatch between the design of the program, and which of the database.
Meanwhile, the problem is not that 
ORM solves the problem of the 

Using declarative programming to manipulate data is a lesson that deserves a conscious thought.


The lessons we acquired during the early years is

The design of the database could be optimised for accomplishing certain kind of tasks.
The database, for now, 


It is ok to have areas where those model come to together to impose constraints on each other.
This where the creative aspect of programming must be considred seriously.

I think that the lack of support to SQL in IDE is the reason behind to the pervasiness of ORM. The problem is in using strings for queries.
