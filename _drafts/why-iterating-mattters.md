The software is more than the user interface in the same sense that it is
more than the database and the code.
When we are to build a table or a table, we now where we are heading
toward. We now exactly how it will end up looking like, even approximately,
we now.
We can draw in a modelling software, we can make it move, we know what the
mouvement are and the user could imagine that in the world.
But for software user, the interface is the software.
How can we know we are building the right thing?
We don't know. We just assume we are doing so.
We don't know how the solution will look like in the beginning.
But does a static interface conveys much of a solution?
At best, a set of static interfaces enables the team to test the problem
solved by those interfaces.
Does that solution fits well with the other parts?
Does the interaction as a whole makes sense to the user?
The sum is more than the sum of the parts.
The requirements are more than the sum of expressed requirements.
When we treat the written documents as the requirements.
We will miss the infinite set of interactions between the requirements.
Same for the high-level view of the sytsem.
Each view frees us from a set of constraints and enables us to express
the set of forces in that view.
But, the software is more than the sum of its views.
It is the interactions between the views that matters.
When we design to a specified view, we will optimise for it, and we
will make decisions that could be significant in the other views of the system.
More dangerous this will be when the view is not the user
view or the business view.
