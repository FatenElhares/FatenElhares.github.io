Hi! I am Hares Faiez. I am a programmer.

I am a software engineering graduate.
I have been working on software products for a while.
I used to work with different technologies.
I have joined teams at different locations
and have worked with people from various backgrounds.

I can help you improve the quality your software, both the code itself
and the development process.
Then, I can help you ingrain the best development practices for your context.

Worried about the slow and unreliable deploymet process?
Upset about the long time of adding features and fixing bugs?

I can help with that, get in touch.
