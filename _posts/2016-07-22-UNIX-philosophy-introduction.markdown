What is a good software?
A software that does everything you expect from? A one with an attractive user interface? well documented one ?
The definition of a good software is context-specific, and a good software for a person may not be the same for an other.
Everyone has its metrics and its view of a good software.

But, what about a useful software?
We can get the definition of a useful software:

“A useful software is the software that is able to be used for a practical purpose.”

It may not be the best solution, it may not be optimized, it may not look good, but it solves the problem facing us now. It accomplishes the practical purpose it is built for.
For a software engineer, it is generally complex to build a useful software.
We cannot predict many aspects of a software up-front, but, we can design our software to be adaptable and easy to change and to enhance. So, we can make further changes and improvements easily in the future to meet more specifications.
And we have many principles, patterns and values to guide us.

Unix and Unix-like systems have been built with some great design philosophies in mind, they are still useful nowadays, you see, and they are not that good tools — like any other software.

Through this collection of posts, I tried to help you and myself to explore some of the most known UNIX design decisions and to learn from them in order to create better software — a good-enough software.
