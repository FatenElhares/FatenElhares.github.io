In an environemnt where feedback is highly valued, 
stakeholders often try the software as it is being developed.
That changes their view as well as their expectations.
Using of the existing system as a reference for conversations,
they can express their problems clearly to the team.

Things change all the time.
Taking a lot of decisions early is rarely beneficical in the long run;
unless for having rich conversations,
these decisions have huge cost and little value;
Indeed, they need to be revsited frequently.
We work toward requirements and we get them when we are done.
Software requirements, like design, are emergent.

We start with assumptions.
We assume that listing the invoices will help the client find
and update his target invoice.
But, does that really meet the need of the customer
that wants to update the last invoice due to a typing issue?
I am not sure of that.
That depends on where the invoices are found, 
what the clients are really using our system
for, when they do it, and how the software fits in their
life.
All of that requires continuous investigation, toughful reflection,
and a lot of trial-and-error.

We work on problems,
and solving a problem changes the setting of the next one.
We approach our problems one by one.
We identify the problem, we assume a solution, we test it, we get feedback,
we learn, and we reflect on our understanding of the problem as well as the
adequacy of the solution.
We repeat this until we come up with a good solution to the right problem.
And only when we end up with proof of viability of a solution
that we take it as a requirement.

Another problem is that identifying the scope of the software early
hinders our ability to learn and inquire deliberately.
The stakehodlers' views change continuously.
They learn more about the solution.
Their interaction with the software gives birth to a set 
of patterns by which they establish rules and habits of use.
This invalidates most of our early decisions.
