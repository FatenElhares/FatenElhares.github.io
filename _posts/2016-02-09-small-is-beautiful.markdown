I find the tendency for solving problems through blindly increasing numbers
is a bit confusing.
Scaling teams, tools, platforms could induce more problems.

Small is simple. Small is also tiny and light.

Small tools offer flexibility.
Flexibility in the way that they these tools are easily changed and replaced.

Small solutions are reusable.
Reusable software is useful in contexts where it was valuable.
The smaller it is, the more it is open for composition with other tools and
the bigger the number of contexts where it would be helpful.

Small modules help to avoid duplications.
Small modules lead to knowledge centralization, wich means a better
encapsulation of knowledge.
Then, if we want to introduce a new bit of logic,
we have to change only one module.

It is often better to think in the small.
Thinking about small solutions is hard, but beneficial.

Small from the point of view of the client.
Or better, from the point of view of the problem itself;
The smallest possible solution that works.

Small solutions do not solve all the problems. Problems are always
surrounded by complexity. Identifying their roots is usually hard.
Let alone solving them.
Smallness offers possiblities to learn fast, to try quickly and to
take the leap early.

Let's always remember that what is small now may not be regarded that way
in the future.

The definition of small is contextual.

To understand how much a small thing could be,
let's try to think harder about our problems.
