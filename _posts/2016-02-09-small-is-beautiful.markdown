Maybe it is another fallacy that arises from applying the metaphor of manufacturing
that we strive all the time for scaling.

Scaling our teams, our tools, our plateforms,...

Small is simple. Small is also tiny and light.


Small tools offer flexibility.
Flexibility in the way that they are easily updated and replaced.
They do not require such a big ceremony to accomplish their tasks or
to be manipulated.

Small solutions are reusable.
Reusable software is useful in contexts it has been grown to operate into.
The smaller it is, the more it is open for combination with other tools and
the bigger the number of contexts where it could be valuable.

As programmers, it is often profitable to think about small solutions.

Small interfaces, small tools,...

Small from the point of view of the consumer.

That may be us, other stakeholders or the end user.

Small solutions do not solve all the problems, they solve the more
important one given the actual context.

Choosing scaling as a solution to a problem indicates either that we are
not focusing on the right problem or that we are not thinking hard enough about
the right solution.
