In software development, we are often driven by a myth.
The myth of scale.
Maybe it is a fallacy that has been emerging from the manufacturing analogy.
Or may be it is just another inherent aspect of our human nature.
But, I find that our hope for finding solutions through blindly increasing numbers
is misleading.

We are striving all the time for scaling.
Scaling our teams, our tools, our platforms...
But we end up having more problems.

Small is simple. Small is also tiny and light.

Small tools offer flexibility.
Flexibility in the way that they are easily updated and replaced.
They do not require big ceremonies to do their jobs.

Small solutions are reusable.
Reusable software is useful in contexts it has been grown to operate into.

The smaller it is, the more it is open for combinations with other tools and
the bigger the number of contexts where it could be valuable.

Small modules help to avoid duplications.
Small modules lead to knowledge *centralization*, wich means a better
encapsulation of knowledge.
Then, if we want to introduce a new bit of logic,
we have to change only one module.

Small teams deliver better software.
Working together in small teams is easier. Communication is fluid,
therefore, progress is the only option.

Achieving a sustainable flow is a normal consequence of small teams.

It is often better to think in the small.
Thinking about small solutions is hard, but beneficial.

Small interfaces, small tools, small teams...

Small from the point of view of the consumer;
us, other stakeholders or the end user.
Or better, from the point of view of the problem itself;
The smallest possible solution that works.

Small solutions do not solve all the problems. Problems are always
surrounded by complexity. Identifying the roots is usually hard.
Let alone solving them.
Smallness offers possiblities to learn fast, to try quickly and to
take the leap early.

Let's always remember that what is small now may not be regarded that way
in the future.

The definition of small is contextual.

To understand how much a small thing could be,
let's try to think harder about our problems.
