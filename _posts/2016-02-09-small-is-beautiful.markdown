Maybe it is one of a bulk of fallacies that have been emerging as a consequence
of blindly using cargo manufacturing as a reference while driving software
development efforts.
Or may be it is just another inherent aspect of our human nature.
But, I think that our bais toawrd solving our problems by increasing numbers
is no more than an escape from our problems.

We are striving all the time for scaling.
Scaling our teams, our tools, our plateforms...
But we end up having more problems.

Small is simple. Small is also tiny and light.

Small tools offer flexibility.
Flexibility in the way that they are easily updated and replaced.
They do not require a big ceremony to do their jobs.

Small solutions are reusable.
Reusable software is useful in contexts it has been grown to operate into.
The smaller it is, the more it is open for combinations with other tools and
the bigger the number of contexts where it could be valuable.

Small teams are easier to move.
Working together became simple. Communication is fluid,
therefore, progress became the only option.
Achieving a sustainable flow is a normal consequence of small teams.

It is often better to think in the small.
Thinking about small solutions is hard, but beneficial.

Small interfaces, small tools, small teams...

Small from the point of view of the consumer;
us, other stakeholders or the end user.
Small is easily consumed by all of us.

Small solutions do not solve all the problems, they solve the more
critical ones given the actual context.

But, Let's always remember that what is small now may not be regarded that way
in the future.

The definition of small is contextual.

To understand how much a small thing could be,
let's try to think harder about our problems.

And always put in front of us a note saying:
"Good one! But try to make that smaller".
