I am learning touch typing for quite a while now. That is mostly because it is
fun. Typing that fast, that illusionary control, isn't it astonishing?
It is a valuable endeavor by the way. I learned a lot from it.
I will shed a light, here, about what I acquired and how that affected in my workflow.

Typing is a tool. We use it to copy the words from our minds to the computer.
A tool is mostly profitable when it is invisible, a part of its user, and so is typing.
When typing does not require a dedicate amount of energy, it becomes easy to write,
to edit, and to delete text.
It is about taking away the mental barrier of the high cost of typing.
That helped me to make habbits, such as daily writing and documenting thoughts, easier
to keep.

Another thing I learned from touch typing is how 'Less is more' works in the real world.
The less I focus on speed and start putting that effort on writing the right thing, the faster I am.
This translates very well to the world of programming and making design decisions.
Indeed, the faster I rush and make a decision, the more it turns out to be a bad fit.

Most of the time of the programmer is spent thinking.
I type far less code as I gain more experience and I learn new things
, and some of the most shining programmers I know are not touch typists. 
Meanwhile, typing fast is good for experimentation.
My mind is often fooled by false symmetries and confirmation bias.
This becomes obvious when I work on subtle abstractions or new code bases,
which is most of time by the way.
I often find aspects of the existing code that I have missed only late;
after I make a series of decisions.
But, when I work through tiny increments and I translate my thinking to a test ealy,
that class of mistakes fades away.
I am able to spot those fallacies early that way.
I use the written test, also, to judge the fitness of the next knowledge within
the existing code.
It is not unusual for me to rewrite or to remove the last lines of code I write,
that it valuable because, that way, I dismiss the assumptions behind that code 
and I learn what could be a good fit for the situation.
That could be done in mind sometimes,
but, for complex situations or for legacy code bases, it is easy to be fooled by complexity.
