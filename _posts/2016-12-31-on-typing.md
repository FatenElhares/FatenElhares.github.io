I am learning touch typing for a while now, because that's fun.
Typing that fast, that illusionary control, isn't it astonishing?
It is a valuable endeavor by the way.
My workflow has been improving since I started typing fast.

Typing could be seen as a tool.
We use it to move expressions in our minds to the computer.
A good tool is invisible. It is an indissociable part of its user, and so is typing.
When done well, the activity of typing is not there anymore, we don't feel its existence,
there is only thoughts flipping on the screen as we mean to.
It turns out to be a hidden part of a bigger process such as writing or programming.
This was pretty useful to me as I was working toward internalizing habbits such as daily blogging.

Another thing I learned from touch typing is how 'Less is more' works in the real world.
The less I focus on speed and put in more effort into pressing the convenient keys,
the faster I type.
This translates very well to the world of programming and the making of design decisions.
It is a pattern of thinking. 
Indeed, the faster I rush and make a decision, the more it turns out to be a bad fit.

As a programmer,
I reassure that most of the time of the programmer is spent thinking.
If it is not the case, either the task being done shall be automated, or the code
being written shall be thrown away as soon as possible.
I type far less code as I acquire more experience 
and learn new ways of ways of problem-solving.
Meanwhile, typing fast is nice for experimentation and for testing hypothesis.
For a certain class of programming activities, 
it is important to get feedback about the work being done as soon as possible.

This is often the case when I work on code bases I never dealt with before.
My mind is easily fooled by false symmetries and biases.
Thus, I find aspects of the actual code that I have missed only late.
I am able to spot those fallacies early when I make hypothesis about the existing code
and test them before going on with a series of thoughts and making a set of new decisions.
Typing fast here is helpful for writing automated checks, 
knowing that I will throw out some lines of code.

It is not unusual for me to rewrite or to remove the last lines of code I write.
There is a lot of value in those lines. They help me dismiss the false assumptions 
I made and learn what could be a better fit for in next attempts.
