I have been learning touch typing for a while now. It is a valuable endeavor.
The practice entails flexibility. And by reflecting on my behavior,
I am witnessing patterns and extracting lessons.
The lessons won't apply everywhere.
But, in order to improve my workflow, I am trying to establish
their usefulness, as well as the context where each brings the most benefit.

A tool could be described as a continuum of the master if it is being used adequately.
The fluency facilitates the task and leaves a room for creativity in the performence.
Likewise, each problem the user faces with a tool hinders his ability
to focus more on the outcome.
He may find himself struggling with the tool instead of accomplishing his intended
mission.

Activities, as rigid as typing, could benefit from this view of tooling.
When shaped as a tool, typing moves expressions in the human mind to the computer.
So, mastering its intricacies could make this process straightforward
and eliminates waste in time and in energy.
This turns out to be quite useful to me.
I was working toward internalizing habits such as writing and taking notes while reading.
Typing them quickly has been helping me to keep focus
and to avoid breaking up my line of thoughts.

Another thing I learned from touch typing is how 'Less is more' works in the real world.
The less I focus on speed and put more effort into pressing the right keys,
the faster I type.
This translates very well to the world of programming. It is a pattern.
The faster I rush and make a decision,
the faster I make decisions that turn out to be a bad fit in the system as a whole.

As a programmer, I type far less code as I acquire more experience
and I learn new approaches to deal with problems.
Optimising for typing speed is not a resonable idea, even when I am late in the schedule.
However, typing fast is nice for running experiments and checking hypothesis.
If the code is not simple, it is hard to put it all in my mind when I am about to change it.
I should validate the assumptions I am making about the behaviour of the system early.
This is often the case when I am exploring a new code base
or when I work on a code base I never dealt with before.

I find aspects of the actual code that I have missed only late.
I am able to spot those fallacies early when I make hypothesis about the existing code
and test them before going on with a series of thoughts and making a set of new decisions.
Typing fast here is helpful for writing automated checks,
knowing that I will throw away some lines of code,
if not most of them, in the pursuit of learning.

By the way, it is not unusual for me to rewrite or to remove lines of code I wrote.
There is a lot of value in there if we take away the evasive belief
that effort is correlated with progress.
