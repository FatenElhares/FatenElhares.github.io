I am learning touch typing for a while now. That's a lot of fun.
Typing that fast, that illusionary control, isn't it astonishing?
It is a valuable endeavor.
The practice entails flexibility, and by reflecting on the behavior, 
one witnesses patterns and extracts lessons.
The lessons won't apply anywhere, but a reasonable person will notice
their utility and will work toward improving its own use of them.

A good tool is invisible in the sense that it is an indissociable part of the user.
Typing moves expressions in the mind to the computer.
When done well, we don't feel the typing,
we see thoughts flipping on the screen as we mean to instead.
This turns out to be quite useful to me.
I was working toward internalizing habits such as writing and taking notes while reading.
Most of the notes I take are sketches and diagrams,
but from time to time, I write a quote or a reminder into my Evernote notebook.
Typing it quickly helps me keep focus and avoid breaking up my line of thoughts.

Another thing I learned from touch typing is how 'Less is more' works in the real world.
The less I focus on speed and put in more effort into pressing the convenient keys,
the faster I type.
This translates very well to the world of programming and the making of design decisions.
It is a pattern of thinking. 
Indeed, the faster I rush and make a decision, the more it turns out to be a bad fit.

Optimising for typing speed is not a good idea, even when we are late.
As a programmer,
I reassure that most of the time of the programmer is spent thinking.
If it is not the case, either the task being done shall be automated, or the code
being written shall be thrown away as soon as possible.
I type far less code as I acquire more experience 
and learn new ways of problem-solving.
Meanwhile, typing fast is nice for experimentation and for testing hypothesis.
For a certain class of programming activities, 
it is important to get feedback about the work being done as soon as possible.

This is often the case when I work on code bases I never dealt with before.
My mind is easily fooled by false symmetries and biases.
Thus, I find aspects of the actual code that I have missed only late.
I am able to spot those fallacies early when I make hypothesis about the existing code
and test them before going on with a series of thoughts and making a set of new decisions.
Typing fast here is helpful for writing automated checks, 
knowing that I will throw out some lines of code.

It is not unusual for me to rewrite or to remove the last lines of code I write.
There is a lot of value in those lines. They help me dismiss the false assumptions 
I made and learn what could be a better fit for in next attempts.
