Hi! My name is Faiez Hares. I am a programmer.
I like reading, writing, running, and taking pictures.
I write about software. most of my posts are about software design.
Sometimes, I complain about languages too.
I like to study programming languages and product design.
 
I enjoy exploring new programming approaches
and discussing unusual ways of solving design problems.

I will be happy to discuss some ideas with you and to get feedback about my work.
Here is my email address **{{ site.email }}**.
If you have something in mind, drop me a note and let's talk.
