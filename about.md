Hi! I am Hares Faiez. I am a programmer.

I have been working on software products for a while.
I used to work with different technologies.
I have joined teams at different locations
and have worked with people from various backgrounds.

I can help you improve the quality your software, both the code itself
and the development process.
Then, I can help you ingrain the best development practices for your context.

I offer private training sessions, too, in agile software development, refactoring, TDD, BDD,
evolutionary desgin and architecture, and functional programming.

Worried about the slow and unreliable deploymet process?

Upset about the long time of adding features and fixing bugs?

Have a big ball of mud that turns out to be valuable for your business?

You need to improve the case?

I can help with that, get in touch.
