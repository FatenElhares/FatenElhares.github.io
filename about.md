I am Hares Faiez.
I am software engineering graduate from
National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technologies of Tunisia (INSAT).
I like programming.
I enjoy bringing tales from the province of imagination into the realm of reality.
I work toward honing my skills and improving my knowledge in sofware development.
You will find some ideas and stories about the problems I am dealing with here.
I will be very happy to receive opinions 
and to learn about experiences around the subjects I write about.
