Hi! I am Hares Faiez. I am a programmer.
I am a software engineering graduate from the National Institute of Applied Sciences
and Technologies of Tunis.

I have been writing code since a while.
I worked on various technologies together with multiples teams.
Here, I tell the stories of my little discoveries
and I share thoughts from my journey in the software world.

I will be happy to get feedback
and learn about your stories with what I write about.
